## Scrobble my Jam

A client side script to scrobble playback from the wonderful [This is My Jam](http://thisismyjam.com). Should be usable as a Bookmarklet for use on any platform, or easily refactored into a Browser Extension for those that support such things.

To work with the code in this repo you will need a Last.FM API key, from http://last.fm/api. Assign the key and secrets to appropriate variables near the base of the file.

Hopefully this is just a temporary measure pending native support. But as the adage goes, if it doesn't scrobble, it doesn't count, so here's something to tide us through.
